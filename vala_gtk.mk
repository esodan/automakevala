# To compile Vala sources for UI interfaces using GTK+, first include vala.mk,
# follow its documentation in order to define all required variables; then
# include this file, is more clear if include sentence is inmediatelly after the one for
# vala.mk, if you are including another file, like valalib.mk, that includes vala.mk, you should
# include this file after it.
#
# Set VALA_GTK_RESOURCES to your XML resources file using GLib format;
# set VALA_GTK_UI to all your xml UI as defined by GtkBuilder and may created
# by Glade to be attached as resources to your binaries; also, set VALA_GTK_IMAGES
# to all image resources to be attached to your binaries as resources.
